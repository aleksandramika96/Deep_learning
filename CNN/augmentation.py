# Data augmentation is a technique for generating more elements \\
# of training dataset by augmenting samples through random image transformations that \\
# returning images that look plausible. The goal of this solution is that the train model will \\
# never see the same image twice. This attitude allows the model to see more aspects of \\
# processed data and create better generalizations.
